So you actually wanna use this program, eh?
To do that solve these riddle three:

HOW TO SETUP THE ZEMOND SECURITY PROGRAM
===R0NAM1 2022===

You can either setup Zemond on a Bare Metal host or a virtual machine, it's not picky.
Recommended to use Debian, GUI optional.

1. Create a Directory on Root that has normal user permissions, this will be where the Zemond program lives with Docker and Python.

2. Download the latest release and unpack the contents into the said directory.

3. Make sure you have Docker installed along with python, don't worry about dependancies, as a Virtual Enviroment is provided.

4. Make sure you have a storage directory configured, this can be the local files system, or anything you want. You can even treat it like cache.
